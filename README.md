# twitter_stock_analyzer
A modolurized version of a web app available on my portfolio website. It pulls tweets from twitter (using TweePy module) and analyzes the polarity of the tweets using NLTK's Vader Sentimer Analyzer. It also utilizes matplotlib to create a graphical representation of the results.
